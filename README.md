# Development

Styles are compiled using Gulp/PostCSS to polyfill future CSS spec. You'll need [Node](https://nodejs.org/), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) and [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com) installed globally. After that, from the theme's root directory:

```bash
# Install
yarn

# Run build & watch for changes
$ yarn dev
```

Now you can edit `/assets/css/` files, which will be compiled to `/assets/built/` automatically.

The `zip` Gulp task packages the theme files into `dist/<theme-name>.zip`, which you can then upload to your site.

```bash
yarn zip
```

# PostCSS Features Used

- Variables - Simple pure CSS variables

### Cryptocurrency Analysis
Bitcoin is the leading and dominant force  (~40% market dominance) within the cryptocurrency market and to a large extent determines the price action for the rest of the cryptocurrency market.

When the price of Bitcoin increases, so does the rest of the market. When the price of Bitcoin falls, so too does the rest of the cryptocurrency market. Where Bitcoin goes, the rest of the market tends to follow.

As long as Bitcoin continues to hold the dominant market capitalization within the cryptocurrency space, the movements of Bitcoin will be to a large extent reflected by the rest of the market.
